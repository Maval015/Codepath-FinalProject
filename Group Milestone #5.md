## Overview

### Description

Fitbuddy is meant to function as a fitness tracker, where users are able to log their daily
workouts/meals, and also share their progress with their friends!

### App Evaluation

Category: Social
Mobile: The app also allows users to use their cameras, and gives real-time updates on their progress!
Story: This app gives users a journaling alternative for their fitness goals!
Market: The fitness industry is one of the largest their is, so a well formatted "Buddy" would go a long way.
Habit: The app is designed for daily use, since it primarily focuses on the day-to-day aspect of working out.
Scope: With the social/tracking elements combined, I say the app is rather dynamic.
